custom ascii art files i made for use in neofetch

## Preview

## How to use
Clone the repo or download its contents

`
git clone https://github.com/Adithyan-KV/neofetch_ascii.git
`

To use the custom ASCII image in neofetch use the command

`
neofetch --source path/to/ascii/file
`

If you don't wanna go through the hassle of type in the long command every time you want to display the art in neofetch, you can make it display the ASCII art by default. The proper way to do it i guess would be to edit the config files for neofetch itself. But i personally prefer tweaking stuff in my .bashrc file for all my customizations. So I would rather create an alias for `neofetch` as `neofetch --source path/to/ascii/file` in my .bashrc (or the rc file for whatever shell you are using)
